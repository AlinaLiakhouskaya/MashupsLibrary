# Portfolio Link

This mashup adds multiportfolio support to the entity details view.
For example, you can link Company portfolio => Work and then Work => Product portfolio at the same time to show multilevel
hierarchy. Also that's possible to link multiple portfolios to Work, for example Company portfolio => Work and then Sales
portfolio => Work at the same time.

Be careful, in case you want to use hierarchical view or lists, you need to setup metrics.

Sample mashup config:
```
{
    // Name of project's process custom field which mashup will use to decide project is portfolio or not.
    // Should be added only to processes which are for portfolio projects, DO NOT it to work processes.
    "portfolioTypeCustomFieldName": "PortfolioType",
    // All portfolio configurations.
    "portfolios": [
        {
            // Default portfolio setup.
            // This config will be used for portfolio projects which process "portfolioTypeCustomFieldName" custom
            // field value is "Company Portfolio".
            "name": "Company Portfolio",
