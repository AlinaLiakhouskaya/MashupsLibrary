Tag Linker
==========

The Tag Linker Mashup is a Mashup for [TargetProcess](http://www.targetprocess.com) that allows you to 
link to other entities in TargetProcess through the use of tags.  Simply put `#(entity ID)` as a tag name 
(for example: `requires#208`) and clicking on the tag will take you to that entity.

[Download the Mashup's ZIP Archive](https://github.com/downloads/TargetProcess/MashupsLibrary/Tag%20Linker.zip)
