Details Hider
=============

The Details Hider Mashup is a very, very, very simple Mashup for 
[TargetProcess](http://www.targetprocess.com) that removes the system 
messages at the bottom of each page (such as page generation time, the Whats New link, 
and the free version notification).

[Download the Mashup's ZIP Archive](https://github.com/downloads/TargetProcess/MashupsLibrary/DetailsHider.zip)

Installing the Mashup with TargetProcess
----------------------------------------

1. In your TP site, navigate to ```Settings > (System Settings) > Mashups```
2. Click "Add New Mashup"
3. In the "Name" field, enter a name unique to this Mashup - for example "Details Hider"
4. In the "Placeholders" field, enter ```footerPlaceholder```
5. Copy and paste the contents of the [DetailsHider.js](https://raw.github.com/TargetProcess/MashupsLibrary/master/DetailsHider/DetailsHider.js) file in the "Code" box.
6. Click Save


Troubleshooting
---------------

**I don't have a _JavaScript/Mashups/_ folder in my TP install path!**

1. Make sure that you are running TargetProcess version 2.22 or newer.
2. By default, this folder can be found at _C:\inetpub\wwwroot\TargetProcess2\wwwroot\JavaScript\Mashups_
