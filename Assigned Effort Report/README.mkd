Assigned Effort Report
======================

*This mashup works from __v.2.23.0__*

The Assigned Effort Report is a simple report that shows the total amount of open effort assigned to users across all projects and all roles.  You can then expand each user to see 
a list of the assignments and their associated effort values and roles.

Navigate to ```Reports > (People) > Assigned Effort Report``` to see the report.
