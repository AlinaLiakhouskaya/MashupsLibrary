Kanban Card Rotter
==================

The Kanban Card Rotter mashup is an advanced mashup that "rots" cards on your Kanban board according to how long they have been in progress.  
The more a card has exceeded your threshold, the more brown the cards will look.  If they have fully exceeded a maximum threshold, the mashup 
will have them pulsate red.  The mashup allows you to visualize which cards have been in progress for long periods of time

Installing the Mashup with TargetProcess
----------------------------------------

1. In your TP site, navigate to ```Settings > (System Settings) > Mashups```
2. Click "Add New Mashup"
3. In the "Name" field, enter a name unique to this Mashup - for example "Card Rotter"
4. In the "Placeholders" field, enter ```Project_Planning_Kanban_KanbanBoard```
5. Copy and paste the contents of the [Kanban Card Rotter.js](https://raw.github.com/TargetProcess/MashupsLibrary/master/Kanban%20Card%20Rotter/Kanban%20Card%20Rotter.js) file in the "Code" box.
6. Look for the two variables at the top.
7. Change the ```rottingDaysAllowed``` to the number of days you will allow before the cards begin to rot (turn brown)
8. Change the ```rottingDaysMaximumAllowed``` to the upper threshold of days.  After a card has been in progress for this long it will begin to pulsate red.
9. Open the Kanban Board, sit back, and enjoy!



Troubleshooting
---------------

**I don't have a _JavaScript/Mashups/_ folder in my TP install path!**

1. Make sure that you are running TargetProcess version 2.22 or newer.
2. By default, this folder can be found at _C:\inetpub\wwwroot\TargetProcess2\wwwroot\JavaScript\Mashups_
